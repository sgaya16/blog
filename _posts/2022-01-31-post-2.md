_Spoilers for Pokémon Legends: Arceus will be in this article. Don't keep reading if you want to avoid them!_

Last Friday was a special day for me. A day I had been waiting for since last year. A day I had marked on my calendar.

You may ask: "why was this day so important to Sara?". Reader, it was because my copy of Pokémon Legends: Arceus came in the mail :')

I have been a longtime fan of the Pokémon series. One of the first games I ever played on my Gameboy Advanced was Pokémon Ruby, and I still have the cartridge for sentimental reasons (also my 6-year-old brain thought that if I held onto the cartridge it'd be worth millions by now; I admire her attempt to predict the future gaming market). Since then I have played almost every Pokémon game that has come out, including the recent Sword & Shield.

Many others have a favorite Pokémon game from their childhood that left an impression on them. Several of my friends see Diamond & Pearl as possibly the greatest Pokémon game to be released, and it's always fun to connect with others on the impact Pokémon has had on their lives. It has become a beloved childhood franchise for fans around the world.

But as time passes, people grow up and evolve (see what I did there?). I myself hit a period where I was told I was "too old" to be playing Nintendo games and I abandoned video games for a period of time, Pokémon included (RIP Black & White, I never knew ye). Thankfully that didn't last very long, but it's no secret that there are so many adults now who grew up loving Pokémon and have now abandoned the series. Many have found that while they have grown and developed more mature tastes, the Pokémon series hasn't grown with them. The reality is that it's a game still geared towards children, and a lot of us who were children at the start of the franchise aren't children anymore.

Now it is true that GameFreak has changed certain aspects of the games that take away some of the more challenging mechanics of the originals, the most obvious one I can think of being EXP gaining for all Pokémon in your party, not just the ones who participated in a battle. I personally really liked this change when it came out. I want my Pokémon games to be fun, not frustrating (to cement this point, I once came so close to beating my rival in Pokémon Ruby after a ridiculous amount of tries only to accidentally press the power button on my DS- I proceeded to cry for the rest of the day). But for others, changes like these took away the challenge that made Pokémon fun, and some even resent these updates.

Frankly I still love the Pokémon games and play them because they are cute and fun, like Animal Crossing. But the changes in difficulty, as well as lack of inclusion of all Pokémon from previous games in a new region, has made many turn away from the franchise.

This background is part of what makes Pokémon Legends: Arceus so special- it's the first game in a long time that feels like a return to Pokémon's roots. It's a game that focuses on the Pokémon and the adventure, along with new game mechanics that are a welcome change after 26 years of the same battle style. Now I admit, it took me a little bit to get used to the new mechanics and really fall in love with the game. But it's been really enjoyable to concentrate and use my brain beyond picking out which partners I want on my team.

I'm also so intrigued by the story! You start out as a teen in modern times who is sent to the vast Hisui region (aka the Sinnoh region from D&P) through a rift in the sky. You become a member of the Galactic Expedition team and help the professor of the game fill the region's Pokédex. It's a unique take for a region we already know and love, and it's exciting to get to explore the same region in a whole new way!

The Pokédex completion has become an incredibly essential part of this game. I was never big on filling the Pokédex in previous games- there were other things I'd rather be doing, and I never liked the idea of Pokémon being stuck in those boxes and accessible only through a computer. But the endeavor has become much more compelling to do.

To get a complete Pokémon entry in your dex you can fulfill different research tasks for that Pokémon, such as catching it, defeating it, giving it food, etc. And let me tell you, it's not always easy. Some Pokémon will come attack you (not your Pokémon, YOU) and if you're not careful you may black out in the field. Once you've completed enough research tasks you will have that Pokémon entry marked as complete and you can read all the info about them. Completing entries is key to getting money, gaining rank, and other rewards. It's also pretty satisfying to see the completed entries and the resulting rank promotions.

Later you'll also meet the Diamond and Pearl clans, two rival entities who revere the almighty Sinnoh as their god, but who have different beliefs of what Sinnoh represents- time vs. space (if only they knew!). It's kind of fascinating to see the complex relationship between the Diamond and Pearl clans. They have a rough history that has caused them to hold each other in disdain, and yet there are several core values they share in common.

Part of the main story is you assisting both clans in quelling their Lord Pokémon, protectors of the region who have become agitated due to a mysterious lightning striking them. The way you battle these bosses is such a fun change from older game mechanics. I really like its engaging format- I have to dodge the Lords' fierce attacks while I throw balms that calm them down, and if there's an opening I can battle with my Pokémon to weaken them so I can throw even more balms. It keeps me on my toes, and it's a challenge! I've had to re-attempt some battle a few times before I finally succeed. These boss battles are a refreshing change of pace, and I hope it's included in future games of the series!

Last but not least, you have side quests you can complete throughout the game. These quests come from the villagers of the town you reside in. The quests themselves are pretty average- a villager may ask you to bring them a Pokémon or show them a completed Pokédex entry, etc.- but what I find fascinating about these quests is seeing how people's relationships with Pokémon are so different in this time period. One thing I have never seen in a Pokémon game is whole groups of people who are genuinely terrified of Pokémon. Well, in this game just about everyone is. In these olden times people did not yet understand the relationship that could be had with Pokémon and how these relationships could make society better. Instead it's akin to people's relationships with wild animals in real life- you know of 'em, you may even have a favorite, but you would never actually go seek one out and try to interact with it, let alone try to capture one and keep it as your partner.

It's actually very wholesome to see how my completion of these quests helps people shed their fears and learn to embrace the wonders of having Pokémon partners in their lives; it might even be the most moving & rewarding part of the game for me.

There are so many things I didn't mention to keep this post from getting ridiculously long, but I really have loved this game. It's different in a great way, and while it's not a perfect game it's pretty damn good. I definitely recommend giving it a try, especially if you're a longtime fan of this series like me. Legends: Arceus feels almost revolutionary in its new approach to the Pokémon series, and I hope they continue down this path!
